# Poly Test
This solution requires the GEOS extension to be installed in order to work.
It also requires the use of another table (states) to contain the shape data for the states.

Things you will need
	- GEOS
	- Import states.sql
	- Add DB credentials into connect.php
	- (Probably) PHP 5.6

I was unable to successfully install this extension on Windows, but I
was able to install it on Ubuntu 14.04.
